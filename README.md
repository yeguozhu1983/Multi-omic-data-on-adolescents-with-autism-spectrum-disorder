Raw metagenomic data on adolescents with ASD have been uploaded to NCBI (https://www.scidb.cn/en/s/YrYnI3). Stool metagenomics and metabolomics were conducted to discover and verify unique gut microbial dysbiosis and dysfunctions as well as underlying molecular mechanisms, and to identify potential intervention targets in adolescents with ASD. Besides, urinary metallomics was used to explore the role of metals in gut microbial dysbiosis and dysfunctions, and to identify potential intervention targets in adolescents with ASD. Details could be referred to the study design.
